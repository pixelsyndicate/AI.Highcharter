AI.Highcharter
==============

Simple highcharts creation library

// I've been using HighCharts on a side project of mine, and have built out some fairly complex charting
// for diabetes managment, combined with LINQ and MySQL. 
// I believe i can advance this project as I did with a DUNDAS helper class a few years back. 
// My intent is to use the AI.Highcharter to simplify my work with the Insulin Wizard
